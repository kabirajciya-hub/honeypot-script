A Python-based honeypot tool to detect and block suspicious admin login attempts. It tracks IP addresses, logs metadata like username and location, and blocks repeated offenders using the Windows Firewall.

-  Geo-location lookup using MaxMind GeoLite2 database
-  Tracks repeated attempts per IP
-  Auto-blocks IPs with too many suspicious attempts
-  Stores all data in a SQLite database
-  Writes security alerts to log file
